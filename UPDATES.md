# Team update log

Every change to this repo gets an entry here, **newest first**, so each of us (and each
Claude Code session) can see what the others did before starting work.

**How to add an entry:** copy the template, put it at the top of the list, fill it in, commit it
together with your change.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD · <who> · <short title>
- **What changed:** …
- **Files:** …
- **Heads-up for the team:** … (anything the others must know or do; "None" if nothing)
```

`<who>` is the person the work was done for (their GitHub name), e.g. `saifsaber`, `mmoustafaeditor` or `moemsacod`, even when Claude Code did the typing.

## 2026-09-26 · mmoustafaeditor · Android project wired up: builds from the live game, CI, 1.2
- **What changed:** Finished bringing the Android app into `games/tier-one/`. The APK no longer keeps its own copy
  of the game: Gradle copies `tier-one/index.html` into the app at build time. New workflow
  `build-tier-one.yml` builds the APK on every push that touches the game or `games/tier-one/**`. Version set to
  1.2 (versionCode 3) to match the APK already published. Added `.vercelignore` so `games/` (which holds the
  signing key), `.github/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md` and `UPDATES.md` are not served on sembagames.app.
  Docs updated for the new site layout.
- **Files:** `games/tier-one/app/build.gradle`, `.github/workflows/build-tier-one.yml`, `.vercelignore`,
  `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `games/tier-one/README.md`, `games/tier-one/LAUNCH.md`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** ⚠️ Keep `.vercelignore`: without it the signing key would be downloadable from the site.
  Next Android release is versionCode 4.

## 2026-09-26 · mmoustafaeditor · Studio home page, game moved to /tier-one, Daily archive, APK 1.2
- **What changed:** sembagames.app is now the Semba Games studio home page (official Neon Ring logo, green brand).
  Tier One moved to `tier-one/index.html`, served at sembagames.app/tier-one; share cards link there. In the game:
  "Daily window" is now "Daily Challenge"; tapping a finished Daily opens the full results (it used to do nothing);
  a new *Past challenges* screen keeps the last 120 days on the device. Days played before this change show outcomes
  and your emoji row but not your tweets. Published APK 1.2 (versionCode 3) and bumped the update feed.
- **Files:** `index.html` (now the home page), `tier-one/index.html` (the game), `assets/`, `downloads/TierOne.apk`,
  `api/tier-one/latest.js`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** ⚠️ The game is no longer at the root `index.html`: edit `tier-one/index.html`.
  Stripe Payment Links, once added, should return buyers to `/tier-one` (the home page forwards `?purchase=` there
  as a fallback).

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Studio setup brought over from saifsaber/tier-one
- **What changed:** This repo is now the Semba Studios repo everyone works in (`saifsaber/tier-one` is retired).
  Added the studio README with the banner and clickable Tier One card, the brand art, `CLAUDE.md`, this log,
  and a Tier One game page written from the current game (10 contacts, 1–2 contact sources, Tier 1 at 300+).
  The old launch-kit README moved to `games/tier-one/LAUNCH.md`.
- **Files:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `UPDATES.md`, `.github/assets/`, `games/tier-one/README.md`,
  `games/tier-one/LAUNCH.md` (was `README.md`).
- **Heads-up for the team:** ⚠️ The root `README.md` is now the studio page; the hosting/ads/Stripe guide is
  `games/tier-one/LAUNCH.md`. The game files did **not** move: `index.html`, `api/` and `downloads/` stay at the
  root because sembagames.app and installed apps load them from there. Still to bring over from the old repo:
  the Android Gradle project + `debug.keystore` (into `games/tier-one/`), a GitHub Actions APK build, and the
  `.claude/` session-start hook.

## 2026-09-26 · mmoustafaeditor · Launch kit, balance update and Android 1.1 feed
- **What changed:** Uploaded the web launch kit (the game in `index.html`, Stripe verification, a hosting/ads/
  analytics guide). Then the game got the balance redesign: 10 contacts a day, premium sources (agent, physio,
  airport) cost 2 and budget ones (kitman, barber, leak) cost 1, Tier 1 needs 300+, Career scores ×1.0–1.25 by
  followers, Daily results can be reopened, more replies in EN/ES/AR, share cards point to sembagames.app.
  Added the Android update feed (`api/tier-one/latest.js`, version 1.1 / versionCode 2) and the 1.1 APK.
- **Files:** `index.html`, `verify-purchase.js`, `api/tier-one/latest.js`, `downloads/TierOne.apk`, `README.md`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** This already includes everything from the old repo's unmerged
  `claude/apk-build-sembagames-sync-1cnmkc` branch that players see: the game changes are identical and the
  hosted APK was built from that branch (it has the UpdateChecker). The branch's Java/Gradle source is not here yet.

# History from saifsaber/tier-one (retired)

Paths below are as they were in the old repo.

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Studio logo swapped for the exact design #17
- **What changed:** The hand-drawn vector S is gone. The studio logo is now the exact "Neon Ring"
  design #17 from the approved icon sheet, saved as `semba-logo.png` (512×512, rounded corners) and
  embedded in the studio banner.
- **Files:** `.github/assets/semba-logo.png` (new), `.github/assets/semba-logo.svg` (removed),
  `.github/assets/studio-banner.svg`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** The PNG is upscaled from the icon sheet (~200px source). If anyone has the
  original high-res logo file, drop it in as `semba-logo.png`.

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Official logos: Semba neon S + Tier One T1
- **What changed:** Added vector logos: `semba-logo.svg` (studio, design #17 "Neon Ring": green S in a
  glowing ring) and `tier-one-logo.svg` (yellow T1 badge with red dot). The studio banner now uses the
  Semba logo and neon-green accents; the Tier One card and the game README use the T1 logo.
- **Files:** `.github/assets/semba-logo.svg`, `.github/assets/tier-one-logo.svg`,
  `.github/assets/studio-banner.svg`, `.github/assets/tier-one-card.svg`, `README.md`,
  `games/tier-one/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** Studio brand colour is now neon green `#B6FF3A`; Tier One stays yellow `#FFD23F`.
  The Android launcher icons and `play-store-icon-512.png` were **not** changed yet.

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Docs updated for a three-person team
- **What changed:** README, CLAUDE.md, UPDATES.md and the session-start hook now name all three of us
  (`saifsaber`, `mmoustafaeditor`, `moemsacod`) instead of assuming two people.
- **Files:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `UPDATES.md`, `.claude/hooks/team-sync.sh`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** None.

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Published APK rebuilt with game v1.0.0
- **What changed:** Replaced `games/tier-one/downloads/TierOne.apk` with the CI build of the current
  game (includes mmoustafaeditor's v1.0.0 update). The download link now serves the latest game.
- **Files:** `games/tier-one/downloads/TierOne.apk`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** `versionCode` is still 1, so this installs as a reinstall over the old APK.
  Bump it on the next release.

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Studio repo makeover + team update log
- **What changed:** Turned the repo into the Semba Studios page. New studio README with a
  clickable game card, a full README for Tier One (story, sources, how to play, install, build),
  this update log, `CLAUDE.md`, and a Claude Code session-start hook that shows the latest
  updates automatically.
- **Files:** `README.md`, `UPDATES.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.github/assets/`,
  `games/tier-one/README.md`, `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`.
- **Heads-up for the team:** ⚠️ **The Android project moved to `games/tier-one/`.** The game file is now
  `games/tier-one/app/src/main/assets/index.html` and the APK is `games/tier-one/downloads/TierOne.apk`.
  Pull before you edit. CI now only runs when something under `games/tier-one/` changes.
  The old root copy `workflow-build-apk.yml` was removed (the real workflow is in `.github/workflows/`).

## 2026-09-26 · mmoustafaeditor · Tier One updated to latest version (v1.0.0)
- **What changed:** Synced the game with the latest artifact version, v1.0.0, with the recent
  improvements and feature updates (commit `48fdfdb`).
- **Files:** `app/src/main/assets/index.html` (now `games/tier-one/app/src/main/assets/index.html`).
- **Heads-up for the team:** `downloads/TierOne.apk` was **not** rebuilt in that commit, so the
  download link still serves the build from before this update.

## 2026-09-26 · saifsaber · Initial Android project + first APK
- **What changed:** Imported the Tier One Android project, fixed the Android SDK setup in CI,
  published the first built APK with a direct download link.
- **Files:** whole project.
- **Heads-up for the team:** None.
